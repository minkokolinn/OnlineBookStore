There are two panels in this web app such as Admin Panel and Customer Panel

To login to customer panel as a customer, it is simple. You need to register first and continue your login.

But for admin roles, they are divided into two sub roles like master admin and normal admin

to login admin panel, you need an access code and you can find it in accesscode table of database

Thank you sir, this is just suggestion to use my system for the first time use.
